Public Repository for Call of Duty Project Data

In the Data folder, you will find 5 datasets and a data dictionary. The 2 main dataset contain information about a player's performance in an online match. The first dataset is relatively easy to work with, while the second presents some challenges. The 3 remaining datasets contain information about the Maps, Weapons, and Game Modes contained within the game.

In the Examples folder, you will find 4 detailed examples and corresponding R code. The examples are written to an instructor and discuss how I might use the examples to walk my students through a variety of ideas. 

If you have any feedback, want to share ideas, or have any trouble accessing the data/code, please contact Matt Slifko (mds6457@psu.edu). If you use the data in your classes, tell me about your experience. I would love to hear from you!

As of May 2023, all resources are a work in progress. After presenting at SDSS 2023 and USCOTS 2023, I plan to update the resources based on feedback received.
